    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine 1/2 cup yoghurt, garlic, ginger, spices, salt and chicken in a non-metal bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight to marinate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place rice in a large saucepan and cover with water 3cm above the rice. Bring to the boil and simmer for 8 minutes - the rice won't be cooked all the way through. Strain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large heavy-based casserole pot that has a lid, heat oil and cook onions for 8-10 minutes, stirring often, until very well-browned. Remove with a slotted spoon, leaving oil in the pot, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now add chicken to the hot oil in the pot and stir until browned and sealed. You can do this in batches if you prefer. Return all chicken to the pot and stir through remaining half cup of yoghurt, stock and curry leaves, if using. Season well with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil Top with reserved onions and then spoon over rice. Cover with lid and cook over high heat for 1-2 minutes until rice is steaming, then reduce heat and cook over low heat, covered, for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove lid and stir gently to combine chicken and rice. Garnish with extra curry leaves and fresh coriander leaves, and serve with extra yoghurt.
