    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until slightly tender, 2 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <li> Whisk soy sauce and honey together in a bowl until glaze is smooth. </li>
        <li> Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush with olive oil. </li>
        <li> Place salmon fillet and asparagus on the prepared baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li> Broil in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Drizzle 2/3 of the glaze over salmon and asparagus. Broil until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes. Drizzle remaining glaze over salmon. </li>
    </ol>
